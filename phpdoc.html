            <h2>What is PHP?</h2>
            <article>
                <p>PHP (recursive acronym for PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor) is a widely-used open source general-purpose scripting language that is especially suited for web development and can be embedded into HTML.
                    <br>Nice, but what does that mean? An example:
                </p>
                <h3>Example #1 An introductory example:</h3>
                <code>
                    < !DOCTYPE html>
                    < html>
                    < head>
                    < title>Example< /title>
                    < /head>
                    < body>
                    
                    ?php
                                echo "Hi, I'm a PHP script!";
                            ?>
                    
                    < /body>
                    < /html>*/</code>
                    <p>Instead of lots of commands to output HTML (as seen in C or Perl), PHP pages contain HTML with embedded code that does "something" (in this case, output "Hi, I'm a PHP script!"). The PHP code is enclosed in special start and end processing instructions <?php and ?> that allow you to jump into and out of "PHP mode."</p>
                    <p>What distinguishes PHP from something like client-side JavaScript is that the code is executed on the server, generating HTML which is then sent to the client. The client would receive the results of running that script, but would not know what the underlying code was. You can even configure your web server to process all your HTML files with PHP, and then there's really no way that users can tell what you have up your sleeve.</p>
                    <p>The best part about using PHP is that it is extremely simple for a newcomer, but offers many advanced features for a professional programmer. Don't be afraid to read the long list of PHP's features. You can jump in, in a short time, and start writing simple scripts in a few hours.</p>
                    <p>Although PHP's development is focused on server-side scripting, you can do much more with it. Read on, and see more in the What can PHP do? section, or go right to the introductory tutorial if you are only interested in web programming.</p>
            </article>
                    <h2>What can PHP do?</h2>
                    <article>
                        <p>Anything. PHP is mainly focused on server-side scripting, so you can do anything any other CGI program can do, such as collect form data, generate dynamic page content, or send and receive cookies. But PHP can do much more.</p>
                        <p>There are three main areas where PHP scripts are used.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Server-side scripting. This is the most traditional and main target field for PHP. You need three things to make this work: the PHP parser (CGI or server module), a web server and a web browser. You need to run the web server, with a connected PHP installation. You can access the PHP program output with a web browser, viewing the PHP page through the server. All these can run on your home machine if you are just experimenting with PHP programming. See the installation instructions section for more information.</li>
                            <li>Command line scripting. You can make a PHP script to run it without any server or browser. You only need the PHP parser to use it this way. This type of usage is ideal for scripts regularly executed using cron (on *nix or Linux) or Task Scheduler (on Windows). These scripts can also be used for simple text processing tasks. See the section about Command line usage of PHP for more information.</li>
                            <li>Writing desktop applications. PHP is probably not the very best language to create a desktop application with a graphical user interface, but if you know PHP very well, and would like to use some advanced PHP features in your client-side applications you can also use PHP-GTK to write such programs. You also have the ability to write cross-platform applications this way. PHP-GTK is an extension to PHP, not available in the main distribution. If you are interested in PHP-GTK, visit » its own website.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>PHP can be used on all major operating systems, including Linux, many Unix variants (including HP-UX, Solaris and OpenBSD), Microsoft Windows, macOS, RISC OS, and probably others. PHP also has support for most of the web servers today. This includes Apache, IIS, and many others. And this includes any web server that can utilize the FastCGI PHP binary, like lighttpd and nginx. PHP works as either a module, or as a CGI processor.</p>
                        <p>So with PHP, you have the freedom of choosing an operating system and a web server. Furthermore, you also have the choice of using procedural programming or object-oriented programming (OOP), or a mixture of them both.</p>
                        <p>With PHP you are not limited to output HTML. PHP's abilities includes outputting images, PDF files and even Flash movies (using libswf and Ming) generated on the fly. You can also output easily any text, such as XHTML and any other XML file. PHP can autogenerate these files, and save them in the file system, instead of printing it out, forming a server-side cache for your dynamic content.</p>
                        <p>One of the strongest and most significant features in PHP is its support for a wide range of databases. Writing a database-enabled web page is incredibly simple using one of the database specific extensions (e.g., for mysql), or using an abstraction layer like PDO, or connect to any database supporting the Open Database Connection standard via the ODBC extension. Other databases may utilize cURL or sockets, like CouchDB.</p>
                        <p>PHP also has support for talking to other services using protocols such as LDAP, IMAP, SNMP, NNTP, POP3, HTTP, COM (on Windows) and countless others. You can also open raw network sockets and interact using any other protocol. PHP has support for the WDDX complex data exchange between virtually all Web programming languages. Talking about interconnection, PHP has support for instantiation of Java objects and using them transparently as PHP objects.</p>
                        <p>PHP has useful text processing features, which includes the Perl compatible regular expressions (PCRE), and many extensions and tools to parse and access XML documents. PHP standardizes all of the XML extensions on the solid base of libxml2, and extends the feature set adding SimpleXML, XMLReader and XMLWriter support.</p>
                        <p>And many other interesting extensions exist, which are categorized both alphabetically and by category. And there are additional PECL extensions that may or may not be documented within the PHP manual itself, like » XDebug.</p>
                        <p>As you can see this page is not enough to list all the features and benefits PHP can offer. Read on in the sections about installing PHP, and see the function reference part for explanation of the extensions mentioned here.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="A_simple_tutorial">
            <header><strong><em>A simple tutorial</em></strong></header>
            <h2>What do I need?</h2>
            <article>
                <p>In this tutorial we assume that your server has activated support for PHP and that all files ending in .php are handled by PHP. On most servers, this is the default extension for PHP files, but ask your server administrator to be sure. If your server supports PHP, then you do not need to do anything. Just create your .php files, put them in your web directory and the server will automatically parse them for you. There is no need to compile anything nor do you need to install any extra tools. Think of these PHP-enabled files as simple HTML files with a whole new family of magical tags that let you do all sorts of things.</p>
                <p>Let us say you want to save precious bandwidth and develop locally. In this case, you will want to install a web server, such as » Apache, and of course » PHP. You will most likely want to install a database as well, such as » MySQL.</p>
                <p>You can either install these individually or choose a simpler way. Our manual has installation instructions for PHP (assuming you already have some web server set up). If you have problems with installing PHP yourself, we would suggest you ask your questions on our » installation mailing list. If you choose to go on the simpler route, then » locate a pre-configured package for your operating system, which automatically installs all of these with just a few mouse clicks. It is easy to setup a web server with PHP support on any operating system, including MacOSX, Linux and Windows. On Linux, you may find » rpmfind and » PBone helpful for locating RPMs. You may also want to visit » apt-get to find packages for Debian.</p>
            </article>
            <h2>Your first PHP-enabled page</h2>
            <article>
            <p>Create a file named hello.php and put it in your web server's root directory (DOCUMENT_ROOT) with the following content:</p>
            <h3>Example #1 Our first PHP script: hello.php</h3>
            <code>< html>
                < head>
                < title>PHP Test< /title>
                < /head>
                < body>
                < ?php echo '< p>Hello World< /p>'; ? >
                < /body>
                < /html></code>
                <p>Use your browser to access the file with your web server's URL, ending with the /hello.php file reference. When developing locally this URL will be something like http://localhost/hello.php or http://127.0.0.1/hello.php but this depends on the web server's configuration. If everything is configured correctly, this file will be parsed by PHP and the following output will be sent to your browser:</p>
                <code>< html>
                    < head>
                     < title>PHP Test< /title>
                    < /head>
                    < body>
                    < p>Hello World< /p>
                    < /body>
                   < /html></code>
                   <p>This program is extremely simple and you really did not need to use PHP to create a page like this. All it does is display: Hello World using the PHP echo statement. Note that the file does not need to be executable or special in any way. The server finds out that this file needs to be interpreted by PHP because you used the ".php" extension, which the server is configured to pass on to PHP. Think of this as a normal HTML file which happens to have a set of special tags available to you that do a lot of interesting things.</p>
                   <p>If you tried this example and it did not output anything, it prompted for download, or you see the whole file as text, chances are that the server you are on does not have PHP enabled, or is not configured properly. Ask your administrator to enable it for you using the Installation chapter of the manual. If you are developing locally, also read the installation chapter to make sure everything is configured properly. Make sure that you access the file via http with the server providing you the output. If you just call up the file from your file system, then it will not be parsed by PHP. If the problems persist anyway, do not hesitate to use one of the many » PHP support options.</p>
                   
                   <p>The point of the example is to show the special PHP tag format. In this example we used <?php to indicate the start of a PHP tag. Then we put the PHP statement and left PHP mode by adding the closing tag, ?>. You may jump in and out of PHP mode in an HTML file like this anywhere you want. For more details, read the manual section on the basic PHP syntax.</p>
                   </article>
                   <h2>Something Useful</h2>
                   <article>
                   <p>Let us do something more useful now. We are going to check what sort of browser the visitor is using. For that, we check the user agent string the browser sends as part of the HTTP request. This information is stored in a variable. Variables always start with a dollar-sign in PHP. The variable we are interested in right now is $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'].</p>
                   <p>To display this variable, you can simply do:</p>
                   <h3>Example #1 Printing a variable (Array element)</h3>
                   <code><?php
                    echo $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'];
                    ?></code>
                    <p>A sample output of this script may be:

                    </p>
                    <code>Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1)</code>
                    <h3>Example #2 Example using control structures and functions</h3>
                    <code><?php
                        if (strpos($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'], 'MSIE') !== FALSE) {
                            echo 'You are using Internet Explorer.<br />';
                        }
                        ?></code>

        <section class="main-section" id="General_Installation_Consideration">
            <header><strong><em>General Installation Consideration</em></strong></header>

            <article>
            <p>Before starting the installation, first you need to know what do you want to use PHP for. There are three main fields you can use PHP, as described in the What can PHP do? section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Websites and web applications (server-side scripting)</li>
                <li>Command line scripting</li>
                <li>Desktop (GUI) applications</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For the first and most common form, you need three things: PHP itself, a web server and a web browser. You probably already have a web browser, and depending on your operating system setup, you may also have a web server (e.g. Apache on Linux and macOS; IIS on Windows). You may also rent webspace at a company. This way, you don't need to set up anything on your own, only write your PHP scripts, upload it to the server you rent, and see the results in your browser.</p>
            <p>In case of setting up the server and PHP on your own, you have two choices for the method of connecting PHP to the server. For many servers PHP has a direct module interface (also called SAPI). These servers include Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Server, Netscape and iPlanet servers. If PHP has no module support for your web server, you can always use it as a CGI or FastCGI processor. This means you set up your server to use the CGI executable of PHP to process all PHP file requests on the server.</p>
            <p>If you are also interested in using PHP for command line scripting (e.g. write scripts autogenerating some images for you offline, or processing text files depending on some arguments you pass to them), you always need the command line executable. For more information, read the section about writing command line PHP applications. In this case, you need no server and no browser.</p>
            <p>With PHP you can also write desktop GUI applications using the PHP-GTK extension. This is a completely different approach than writing web pages, as you do not output any HTML, but manage windows and objects within them. For more information about PHP-GTK, please » visit the site dedicated to this extension. PHP-GTK is not included in the official PHP distribution.</p>
            <p>From now on, this section deals with setting up PHP for web servers on Unix and Windows with server module interfaces and CGI executables. You will also find information on the command line executable in the following sections.</p>
            <p>PHP source code and binary distributions for Windows can be found at » https://www.php.net/downloads.php.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Installation_on_Unix_systems">
            <header><strong><em>Installation on Unix systems</em></strong></header>

            <article>
            <p>This section will guide you through the general configuration and installation of PHP on Unix systems. Be sure to investigate any sections specific to your platform or web server before you begin the process.</p>
            <p>As our manual outlines in the General Installation Considerations section, we are mainly dealing with web centric setups of PHP in this section, although we will cover setting up PHP for command line usage as well.</p>
            <p>There are several ways to install PHP for the Unix platform, either with a compile and configure process, or through various pre-packaged methods. This documentation is mainly focused around the process of compiling and configuring PHP. Many Unix like systems have some sort of package installation system. This can assist in setting up a standard configuration, but if you need to have a different set of features (such as a secure server, or a different database driver), you may need to build PHP and/or your web server. If you are unfamiliar with building and compiling your own software, it is worth checking to see whether somebody has already built a packaged version of PHP with the features you need.</p>
            <p>Prerequisite knowledge and software for compiling:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic Unix skills (being able to operate "make" and a C compiler)</li>
                <li>An ANSI C compiler</li>
                <li>A web server</li>
                <li>Any module specific components (such as GD, PDF libs, etc.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When building directly from Git sources or after custom modifications you might also need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    autoconf: 2.59+ (for PHP >= 7.0.0), 2.64+ (for PHP >= 7.2.0)
                </li>
                <li>automake: 1.4+</li>
                <li>libtool: 1.4.x+ (except 1.4.2)</li>
                <li>re2c: 0.13.4+</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The initial PHP setup and configuration process is controlled by the use of the command line options of the configure script. You could get a list of all available options along with short explanations running ./configure --help. Our manual documents the different options separately. You will find the core options in the appendix, while the different extension specific options are described on the reference pages.</p>

    <li>emergency restart in case of accidental opcode cache destruction;</li>
    <li>accelerated upload support;</li>
    <li>"slowlog" - logging scripts (not just their names, but their PHP backtraces too, using ptrace and similar things to read remote process' execute_data) that are executed unusually slow;</li>
    <li>fastcgi_finish_request() - special function to finish request and flush all data while continuing to do something time-consuming (video converting, stats processing etc.);</li>

            <header><strong><em>Connection handling</em></strong></header>
            <article>
            <p>Internally in PHP a connection status is maintained. There are 4 possible states:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>0 - NORMAL</li>
                <li>1 - ABORTED</li>
                <li>2 - TIMEOUT</li>
                <li>3 - ABORTED and TIMEOUT</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When a PHP script is running normally, the NORMAL state is active. If the remote client disconnects, the ABORTED state flag is turned on. A remote client disconnect is usually caused by users hitting their STOP button. If the PHP-imposed time limit (see set_time_limit()) is hit, the TIMEOUT state flag is turned on.</p>
            <p>You can decide whether or not you want a client disconnect to cause your script to be aborted. Sometimes it is handy to always have your scripts run to completion even if there is no remote browser receiving the output. The default behaviour is however for your script to be aborted when the remote client disconnects. This behaviour can be set via the ignore_user_abort php.ini directive as well as through the corresponding php_value ignore_user_abort Apache httpd.conf directive or with the ignore_user_abort() function. If you do not tell PHP to ignore a user abort and the user aborts, your script will terminate. The one exception is if you have registered a shutdown function using register_shutdown_function(). With a shutdown function, when the remote user hits his STOP button, the next time your script tries to output something PHP will detect that the connection has been aborted and the shutdown function is called. This shutdown function will also get called at the end of your script terminating normally, so to do something different in case of a client disconnect you can use the connection_aborted() function. This function will return true if the connection was aborted.</p>
            <p>Your script can also be terminated by the built-in script timer. The default timeout is 30 seconds. It can be changed using the max_execution_time php.ini directive or the corresponding php_value max_execution_time Apache httpd.conf directive as well as with the set_time_limit() function. When the timer expires the script will be aborted and as with the above client disconnect case, if a shutdown function has been registered it will be called. Within this shutdown function you can check to see if a timeout caused the shutdown function to be called by calling the connection_status() function. This function will return 2 if a timeout caused the shutdown function to be called.</p>
            <p>One thing to note is that both the ABORTED and the TIMEOUT states can be active at the same time. This is possible if you tell PHP to ignore user aborts. PHP will still note the fact that a user may have broken the connection, but the script will keep running. If it then hits the time limit it will be aborted and your shutdown function, if any, will be called. At this point you will find that connection_status() returns 3.</p>

            <article>
                <p>Nowadays, databases are cardinal components of any web based application by enabling websites to provide varying dynamic content. Since very sensitive or secret information can be stored in a database, you should strongly consider protecting your databases.</p>
                <p>To retrieve or to store any information you need to connect to the database, send a legitimate query, fetch the result, and close the connection. Nowadays, the commonly used query language in this interaction is the Structured Query Language (SQL). See how an attacker can tamper with an SQL query.</p>
                <p>As you can surmise, PHP cannot protect your database by itself. The following sections aim to be an introduction into the very basics of how to access and manipulate databases within PHP scripts.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind this simple rule: defense in depth. The more places you take action to increase the protection of your database, the less probability of an attacker succeeding in exposing or abusing any stored information. Good design of the database schema and the application deals with your greatest fears.</p>

            <header><strong><em>Hiding PHP</em></strong></header>
            <article>
                <p>In general, security by obscurity is one of the weakest forms of security. But in some cases, every little bit of extra security is desirable.</p>
                <p>A few simple techniques can help to hide PHP, possibly slowing down an attacker who is attempting to discover weaknesses in your system. By setting expose_php to off in your php.ini file, you reduce the amount of information available to them.</p>
                <p>Another tactic is to configure web servers such as apache to parse different filetypes through PHP, either with an .htaccess directive, or in the apache configuration file itself. You can then use misleading file extensions:</p>
                <h3>Example #1 Hiding PHP as another language</h3>
                <code># Make PHP code look like other code types
                    AddType application/x-httpd-php .asp .py .pl</code>
                    <p>Or obscure it completely:</p>
                    <h3>Example #2 Using unknown types for PHP extension</h3>
                    <code># Make PHP code look like unknown types
                        AddType application/x-httpd-php .bop .foo .133t</code>

        <section class="main-section" id="Cookies">
            <header><strong><em>Cookies</em></strong></header>
            <article>
                <p>PHP transparently supports HTTP cookies. Cookies are a mechanism for storing data in the remote browser and thus tracking or identifying return users. You can set cookies using the setcookie() or setrawcookie() function. Cookies are part of the HTTP header, so setcookie() must be called before any output is sent to the browser. This is the same limitation that header() has. You can use the output buffering functions to delay the script output until you have decided whether or not to set any cookies or send any headers.</p>
                <p>Any cookies sent to server from the client will automatically be included into a $_COOKIE auto-global array if variables_order contains "C". If you wish to assign multiple values to a single cookie, just add [] to the cookie name.</p>
                <p>For more details, including notes on browser bugs, see the setcookie() and setrawcookie() function.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Fibers">
            <header><strong><em>Fibers</em></strong></header>
            <article>
                <p>Fibers represent full-stack, interruptible functions. Fibers may be suspended from anywhere in the call-stack, pausing execution within the fiber until the fiber is resumed at a later time.</p>
                <p>Fibers pause the entire execution stack, so the direct caller of the function does not need to change how it invokes the function.</p>
                <p>Execution may be interrupted anywhere in the call stack using Fiber::suspend() (that is, the call to Fiber::suspend() may be in a deeply nested function or not even exist at all).</p>
                <p>Unlike stack-less Generators, each Fiber has its own call stack, allowing them to be paused within deeply nested function calls. A function declaring an interruption point (that is, calling Fiber::suspend()) need not change its return type, unlike a function using yield which must return a Generator instance.</p>
                <p>Fibers can be suspended in any function call, including those called from within the PHP VM, such as functions provided to array_map() or methods called by foreach on an Iterator object.</p>
                <p>Once suspended, execution of the fiber may be resumed with any value using Fiber::resume() or by throwing an exception into the fiber using Fiber::throw(). The value is returned (or exception thrown) from Fiber::suspend().</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
            <header><strong><em>Constants</em></strong></header>
            <article>
                <p>A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script (except for magic constants, which aren't actually constants). Constants are case-sensitive. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.</p>
                <p>The name of a constant follows the same rules as any label in PHP. A valid constant name starts with a letter or underscore, followed by any number of letters, numbers, or underscores. As a regular expression, it would be expressed thusly: ^[a-zA-Z_\x80-\xff][a-zA-Z0-9_\x80-\xff]*$</p>
                <p>It is possible to define() constants with reserved or even invalid names, whose value can only be retrieved with the constant() function. However, doing so is not recommended.</p>
                <h3>Example #1 Valid and invalid constant names</h3>
                <code>?php

                    // Valid constant names
                    define("FOO",     "something");
                    define("FOO2",    "something else");
                    define("FOO_BAR", "something more");
                    
                    // Invalid constant names
                    define("2FOO",    "something");
                    
                    // This is valid, but should be avoided:
                    // PHP may one day provide a magical constant
                    // that will break your script
                    define("__FOO__", "something"); 
                    
                    ?></code>
